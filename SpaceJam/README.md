# Space Jam

## Description
Space Jam is a group project made in the context of "Game's Week" at <Academia de Código_>.
We were given one week to use our recently developed skills with Java (4 weeks into the 14-week bootcamp), and a simple graphics library provided by <Academia de Código_>.

We were given no theme so our inspiration came from one member of our team, who was a profissional basketball player. From there it was a small leap to the classic movie, Space Jam.
With this game we tried to have the player (Michael Jordan) score points against the adversaries (Monstars).
Once the player reaches the opposite net, a new shootout game appears and the player needs to try to score to get 2 points.
