# The Heist

## Description
The Heist is the winning üèÜ team project developed in the context of a Hackathon at <Academia de C√≥digo_>.

9 teams of 5/6 elements were given 24 hours and a theme to develop from scratch a website/app using the tools they learned during the 14 week bootcamp.
Our team, The Hackuna-Matatas, was given as theme the movie Reservoir Dogs from Quentin Tarantino.

Our MVP was to create a website where a user could hire people to do a job for them. Inspired by the plot of Reservoir Dogs, the jobs could be a Diamond Heist, a Bank Robbery or a Supermarket Robbery.
Our servers would then suggest the people in the databse that were recommended for the job chosen and based on the user needs. If the user was satisfied with the recommendations, we would then present a bill based on the cost of the people chosen to perform on the job.

Our objective, post Hackathon, was to make a legitimate version of the website where a user could select a type of job, for example Develop a Website, Design a Logo, Write an article, etc., and the server would consult the database for actual people who registered on the website with the right skills for that job.
